# Bird-PAM: Bird Sound Classification and Passive Acoustic Monitoring

This repository contains my SUNY Poly DSA 598 Capstone Project.

**Goal:**  
Apply machine learning and signal processing techniques to classify bird vocalizations from audio recordings.

**Project Structure**
``
data/              # raw and processed audio (ignored in git)
conf/              # configuration files and metadata
src/               # code for data, features, models, evaluation
models/            # trained models (ignored in git)
reports/           # figures, logs, outputs
``

**Tech Stack:**  
Python 3.12 | NumPy | Pandas | PyTorch | Librosa | Matplotlib | MLflow
